Hello! I am writing documentation based on the provided code. It should look like this (you can use it as a template):

## Actions

### Landing & Site Pages
**Note:** The actions for landing and site pages are the same, but they have separate actions for each.

- **Site Page**: A site page is a more general and versatile page on a HubSpot CMS website. It can contain various types of content and is part of your site's overall navigation and structure.
- **Landing Page**: A landing page in HubSpot CMS is a standalone page typically designed for a specific marketing campaign, with a clear call-to-action (CTA) to capture leads.

#### Get a Landing/Site Page
Retrieve information from a specific page on your website by selecting it from a dynamic drop-down list as an input value.

#### Search Landing/Site Pages
Searches for landing or site pages matching certain criteria. One of these criteria is "Not translated in language," which you can use to filter pages that are missing translations.

#### Get a Landing/Site Page as an HTML File
Get webpage details and an HTML file of its content for easy translation and integration while preserving formatting and layout.

#### Translate a Landing/Site Page from an HTML File
Create a new translation for a landing or site page based on an HTML file input. This enables seamless integration of externally translated content back into the website while maintaining the HTML structure.
**Note:** If you are using this action with a landing or site page that has no translations yet, you need to provide the primary language.

#### Schedule a Landing/Site Page for Publishing
Automate webpage publishing to release translated content at the right time for a better user experience.

## Events
- **On Blog Posts Created or Updated**: Triggers when a blog post is created or updated.
- **On Landing Pages Created or Updated**: Triggers when a landing page is created or updated.
- **On Site Pages Created or Updated**: Triggers when a site page is created or updated.

These events work on a polling mechanism, so you won't be immediately notified about the changes. You can configure the polling interval to range from 5 minutes to 7 days.

This documentation is designed for end users who will interact with the actions and events through a user interface, rather than directly with the methods themselves. The explanations are intended to be clear and user-friendly to ensure easy understanding and use.
